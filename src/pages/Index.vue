              Bitcoin gave us free-circulating money. Ethereum established a framework for
              decentralized engineering. Cardano upgraded and formalized scalability and
              robustness. Arweave revolutionized the paradigm of data permanence.<br><br>
              <b>The next evolution, we think, is an NFT-enabled free-circulation, traceability and
              marketization of intellectual property rights. And by extension, knowledge.</b><br><br>
              <i>Why NFTs?</i><br><br>
              An NFT (Non-Fungible Token) is a public, immutable, permanent and programmable record of
              a digital element. These 4 properties will provide the foundational basis for building
              platforms for open science.<br><br>
              <i>Why decentralization?</i><br><br>
              Democracy requires that the public make their preferences known. They do this through
              signalling mechanisms. When a few select individuals and corporations control those
              mechanisms, democracy becomes an illusion.<br>
              Web3 solves this.
